/*
! ðŸ¤” Problem Description:
- Luke walks from first to last pile of food.
- Before each pile, he can change his food affinity `v` (unlimited times).
- For pile `i`, he can eat only if |v - a[i]| <= x.
- Initially, he can choose any `v` (this does NOT count as a change).
- Find the **minimum number of times he needs to change `v`** during the walk.

? ðŸ§  Approach:
- Maintain a valid affinity range: [L, R].
- For each pile:
    - The food allowed at `i` â†’ Allowed affinity window = [a[i] - x, a[i] + x].
    - Update running window â†’ intersection of (current [L, R]) and this allowed window.
    - If intersection becomes empty â†’ increment change count, reset L, R to new allowed window.
- Start with L = -INF, R = +INF (so first pile doesn't force a change).

*ðŸ”° Sliding Window on Range of Valid v:
- Shrink range every step.
- Reset when invalid.
