?ðŸ§  APPROACH:
- You are allowed to swap characters freely, but t[i] must differ from s[i].
- This means position-wise pairing is required.
- As we go through the string:
  â†’ If current char is '1', and there's an unused '0', we can place a '0' here (t[i] â‰  s[i])
  â†’ If it's '0', and we have unused '1', we can place a '1' here.
- Once we run out of opposite characters, we break.
- All remaining characters must be deleted.

âœ… This guarantees that t[i] â‰  s[i] at each used position.
