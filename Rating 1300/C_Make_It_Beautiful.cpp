/*
!ðŸ¤” Problem Description:
- Given an array of n integers.
- You can perform at most k operations. In each operation, you can increase any array element by 1.
- Each number's beauty = number of 1s in its binary representation.
- Goal: Maximize total beauty (sum of 1s across the whole array) after at most k operations.

?ðŸ§  Approach:
1. Calculate the initial beauty (count of 1s in the array using __builtin_popcountll).
2. For each bit from 0 to 60:
    - For each element:
        - If this bit is currently OFF and we have enough k left to turn it ON:
            - Spend the required k (cost = 2^bit).
            - Increase beauty by 1.
    - Break early if k becomes 0 to save time.

*âŒš Time Complexity:
- O(n * 61)
- Because we check at most 61 bits (bit positions 0 to 60) for each of n elements.

*ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
- O(n)
- Only need to store the array of size n.

?ðŸ”° Example of Bit Checking:
Suppose:
    array[i] = 5;   // Binary: 101
    bit = 1;        // Checking 2nd bit (zero-indexed)

!Check if bit 1 is ON or OFF:
    * Step 1: 
    Calculate mask â†’ (1LL << bit) = (1LL << 1) = 2 â†’ Binary: 010
    * Step 2: Check â†’ (array[i] & mask)
    (5 & 2) â†’ (101 & 010) â†’ 0 â†’ Means bit 1 is OFF (0).
    * Step 3: So condition:
        if ((array[i] & (1LL << bit)) == 0)
        â†’ TRUE â†’ Means this bit is currently OFF and can be turned ON if k allows.
