/*
! ðŸ¤” Problem Description:
- Given a stripe of length `n` containing 'B' and 'W'.
- Goal: Find the **minimum number of white ('W') cells to repaint black ('B')**
  to get at least one continuous segment of exactly `k` consecutive black cells.

? ðŸ§  Approach (Sliding Window on Fixed Size k):
- Use a **fixed-size sliding window** of length `k`.
- For each window, count how many 'W' are present (since they need repainting).
- Track the **minimum repaint count** across all possible windows.

*ðŸ”° Why Sliding Window works:
- Total windows = (n - k + 1)
- For each window:
    - Slide 1 position at a time â†’ O(n) time
    - Keep updating count efficiently â†’ No nested loop needed.
